		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		When a new firmware update is available, the user has to plug their hearing device such as the Oticon OPN or the Oticon ClipConnect
		into their computer and use the Genie 2 updater wizard in order to install the new firmware. This is a very involved process
		regardless of who the end-user is, but the older end-user segment may especially find this step difficult to do themselves.

		<h2>Solution Idea: Wireless Distribution of Firmware</h2>
		With the rise of IoT, devices are now able to exchange information in almost any way we can think of and as such a solution
		has been derived which exclusively utilizes wireless communication in order to perform the firmware update. Additionally
		the solution makes the firmware update process independent of user interaction which will ultimately make the user experience
		seamless.

		<h3>Key assumptions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The hearing aid cannot receive, store nor update new firmware while functioning at the same time.</li>
			<li>Firmware updates may come out each week.</li>
			<li>Firmware updates are relatively small (less than 1 MB). Oticon’s firmware manual states that updates are around 500 KB.</li>
			<li>Firmware updates can be sent via BT and BLE using TCP, which ensures every packet arrives.</li>
			<li>The users will charge their hearing devices at least once per week, and the charging window is long enough to update the
				firmware.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
		<h5>Update only while devices are charging</h5>
		<i>Ensures the user is not interrupted while already using the devices
			<br>
		</i>

		<h5>Download firmware update from an Oticon-owned GIT repository to the user’s smartphone through the Oticon ON application</h5>
		<i>Ensures the integrity of the software, i.e. it was developed and approved by Oticon</i>

		<h5>Transfer software via TCP over Bluetooth to the devices</h5>
		<i>Ensures that the whole firmware package is transferred to the audio device (TCP), and a seamless user experience when updating
			firmware
		</i>

		<h3>Infrastructure Diagram</h3>
		Below is shown an illustration of system infrastructure design, which includes using the smartphone as a middle-man for transferring
		firmware updates to the hearing devices.

		<h3>Updating via Bluetooth and BLE</h3>
		<h4>Oticon ClipConnect</h4>
		The firmware size for the ClipConnect is unknown but is assumed to be within the same range as the OPN firm, i.e. less than
		1 MB. With a regular Bluetooth connection with a theoretical transfer throughput of 24 MBit/s, the transfer time becomes
		less than a second.

		<h4>Oticon OPN (via BLE)</h4>
		Transfer speed for Bluetooth Low Energy is around
		<a href="https://punchthrough.com/blog/posts/maximizing-ble-throughput-on-ios-and-android">2.7 kbps</a>, which for a firmware update of 500KB gives a transfer time of ~25 minutes, if everything goes well. This
		assumes the transfer is not interrupted, such as is the phone is turned off, bluetooth is turned off, or the phone is moved
		outside the bluetooth range of the hearing aid. Another problem to consider when using the phone as a gateway to the internet
		is that the Oticon ON app, as far as we can tell, has to be open due to Apple not allowing for Bluetooth transfers while
		the
		<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/CoreBluetooth_concepts/CoreBluetoothBackgroundProcessingForIOSApps/PerformingTasksWhileYourAppIsInTheBackground.html ">application is not open</a>. This means that the user has to open up the ON app before going to bed, and the app has to
		remain open during the update.

		<h4>Transferring Data via HTTPS and BLE</h4>
		<p>
			A concept application was made for this project which illustrates the possibility of transferring data from an API on the
			internet to an iPhone via HTTPS, and then transfer the data from the iPhone to a BLE peripheral device, such as a hearing
			aid. For this concept application a NodeJS script was used to emulate a BLE peripheral device with a laptop using Bluetooth.
			The iOS application use the framework BlueCapKit (with CoreBluetooth) in order to interface with BLE devices, and the
			networking framework Alamofire to make HTTP(S) requests to API’s.
		</p>

		<p>The project containing the Bleno Node JS script and the XCode project can be found in this
			<a href="https://github.com/thomasnilsson/OticonBluetooth">GitHub repository</a>, under the folder BTLE.</p>

		<p>
			<b>How to run the project with Node JS:</b>
		</p>
<p>(Only works on a device with BLE, such as a laptop from 2012 or later)</p>
		<pre lang="javascript">
			<code>
# Install Bleno
sudo npm install bleno

# Clone the repo
https://github.com/thomasnilsson/OticonBluetooth

# Go to the script folder
cd OticonBluetooth/bleno/examples/echo

# Install all messing dependencies, only works with python 2.7
sudo npm install --python=python2.7 

# Run the script
node main.js</code>
		</pre>

		<h4>Power Concerns and User Experience</h4>
		Neither the phone nor the hearing device should run out of power when updating and there a couple of ways to ensure this
		does not happen. The phone battery will likely not be too affected by the firmware update, but a minimum requirement should
		be that the power is above a certain battery level, e.g. 50% (as with iOS updates). Regarding the hearing device it should
		be required to be charging, in order to ensure the power does not run out, as well as ensuring the user isn’t currently
		using the device. To further ensure the latter an additional requirement can be put on the device, requiring it to be charging
		as well as being at 100%, since it isn’t an ideal time to start updating the firmware if the user wants to quickly charge
		the device in the middle of day because it is running low on power.

		<h4>Ensuring Successful Updates</h4>
		A firmware update is in essence a compiled binary file which can be sent via TCP which divides the file into packets, and
		TCP is a protocol for ensuring every packet arrives if possible. The receiving end which in this case is the embedded device
		will, by abiding by the TCP protocol, know if all packets have arrived. Here we assume the embedded device has a way of
		temporarily storing the new firmware update while it is being transferred, and does not immediately start overwriting the
		already installed firmware. This will in theory ensure that the currently installed firmware update will not be overwritten
		with an incomplete firmware update.

		<h4>Notifying Devices and Pushing Updates Globally</h4>
		<p>The engineers of Oticon will be working actively on improving the firmware for the their audio devices, and when a new
			version is ready it will likely be uploaded to a software repository with GIT. To let Oticon devices know that a new update
			is ready the repository is scanned for changes every day by a service running on one of Oticon’s servers. This service
			will also be responsible for notifying the users around the world that a new update is available, which will be done through
			the Oticon ON app.</p>

		<p>However it would be very inefficient if each user would try to download the firmware from the server at the same time,
			and to alleviate the traffic a roll-out plan has to be established. The roll out plan will make sure that only at certain
			amount of users are given access the new software update at any time. In practice the users would likely be divided into
			batches based on their timezone which allows us to download the firmware package to the user’s phone before bedtime such
			that the devices may be updated during the night.</p>

		<p>Additionally, the user’s timezone gives us their geographical location by proxy, and if they update size was very big,
			a possibility is to use the location in order to minimise the latency from user to server, by placing multiple software
			repository servers around the globe and always have the Oticon ON app select the closest server. However since the firmware
			packages are relatively small this is likely an unnecessary step.

		<h1>Data Collection</h1>
		<h5>NB: All plots are based on randomized dummy data.</h5>

		<h4>Firmware Version Distribution</h4>
		<p>
			Not all users are going to update to the latest firmware for their devices, which can be due to not using the Oticon ON app
			or from not having access to data on their cell phone. To get an insight into the user base it would be of high relevance
			to quantify the firmware distribution world wide, and perhaps map this with other user data (if available) such as country
			and age group. As an example of it could be that users in a certain country have poor wireless and cellular coverage,
			which makes them unable to fetch the updates. Another example related to age is if a certain age group does not use the
			Oticon ON app, then updating the devices becomes hard to do wirelessly.

		<h4>Failed Updates</h4>
		<p>
			Inevitably some firmware updates will fail to be installed which may be caused by a variety of reasons, such as incompatibility
			with older devices. By gathering information on which versions fail, and perhaps implementing a logging system in the
			ON app which provides greater insight into why a certain update failed to install will provide the Oticon engineers with
			very valuable insight.

		<h4>Usage as a Success Metric</h4>
		<p>
			It can be hard to quantify how much a user likes a product but quantifying how much they use a product is a good alternative.
			Usage can be a product of many things: hours active, how often the programme is changed, how much users use the hearing
			aid while being physically active and much more. We will not go into too much detail on how to define usage, but instead
			provide the idea that it can be relevant to look at average usage mapped to a firmware update. The goal of updating firmware
			is to make the user experience better, and if usage goes up after a firmware update then the update would be considered
			a success, whereas if it goes down it would be considered a failure. In the real world the result would likely often be
			closer to neutral than radical changes however.

		<h3>Further Development of Firmware and Oticon ON</h3>
		<p>This idea is not necessarily related to distribution of firmware, but rather on how parts of the firmware on the devices
			and the Oticon ON app can be used to improve the user experience in an innovative way.</p>

		<h4>Mapping Programmes to Location and Time</h4>
		<p>
			Each user will have their own personal preferences in the Oticon ON application such as the shape of sound, and preferred
			gain of low, mid and high-range frequencies, which may change based on where they are, i.e. a noisy or a quiet place,
			but also what time of day it is. We will denote this general set of settings tied to a user a profile.
		</p>
		<p>
			When devices are out in field they can measure noise levels, user’s personal weights which can be mapped to geographical
			location and time of day using the ON app. By collecting this data and using machine learning algorithms such ordinary
			linear regression or random forest we may very well be able to predict what settings would ideal for a specific user,
			given their own profile and collection of how other Oticon user’s with similar profiles adjust their settings given a
			location and time of day.

		</p>
		<p>
			This solution would allow the hearing aid to become very autonomous and the user experience would become very seamless. The
			concept could also be used for certain use cases with augmented reality, where the user does not necessarily have a hearing
			problem, but would rather enhance their ability to hear by filtering out- or enhancing certain frequencies.
